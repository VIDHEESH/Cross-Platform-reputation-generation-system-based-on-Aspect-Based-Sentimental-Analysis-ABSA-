Abstract: 
This project aims to develop a cross-platform reputation generation system based on aspect based 
sentimental analysis (ABSA) solution that provides individuals with a reputation based on 
sentimental analysis. The objective is to assist individuals in generating the appropriate 
reputation on comment made. Machine learning techniques and data analysis are utilized to 
accurately analyze the comments. A dataset containing relevant information of different text and 
their standards is collected. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode 
categorical variables, and ensure data quality. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, 
and machine learning algorithms such as Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), Local 
Context Focus (LCF), BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), LSTM 
(Long Short-Term Memory), GCAE (Gated Convolutional Network with Aspect Embedding), 
IMN (Interactive Multi-task Learning Network), HAPN (Hierarchical Attention-based Position
aware Network), RRC (Review Reading Comprehension), BAT (BERT Adversarial Training), 
LCF-ATEPC (Local Context Focus-Aspect Term Extraction and Polarity Classification) are 
integral to the systemâ€™s ability to generate and visualize reputation scores based on aspect-based 
sentiment analysis of online reviews. Various algorithms are experimented with to determine the 
most effective model for the dataset. A system that incorporates spam filtering, review 
popularity, review posting time, and aspect-based sentiment analysis to generate accurate and 
reliable reputation values. The proposed model computes an entity's numerical reputation values 
and aspects based on opinions collected from various platforms. Our proposed system also offers 
an advanced visualization tool that displays detailed information about its output. Experiment 
results conducted on multiple datasets collected from various platforms (Twitter, Facebook, 
Amazon . . .) show the efficacy of the proposed system compared with state-of-the-art reputation 
generation systems. 
Technology and Frameworks used: ML Algorithms, Scikit-learn, Pandas, matplotlib 
Keywords: Aspect-based sentiment analysis, decision-making, reputation generation, e-commerce, 
opinion mining.
